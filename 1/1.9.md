# 1.9
## Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

```
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) 
      b 
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) 
      b 
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

## Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

---

```
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) 
      b 
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

````

Substitutes to:

```
((if = 4 0)
  5
  (inc ((if = 3 0)
       5
       (inc ((if = 2 0)
            5
            (inc (if = 1 0 )
                 5
                 (inc (if = 0 0)
                 5
                 )))))))
```
Procedure is recursive.

----
```
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) 
      b 
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Substitutes to:

```
(if (= a 4)
    5
    (if (= 3 0)
    6
    (if = 2 0)
    7
    (if = 1 0)
    8
    (if = 0 0)
    9))
```
Procedure is iterative.
