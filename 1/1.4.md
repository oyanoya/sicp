## Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

### Explanation
The function takes parameters 'a' and 'b'. It tests for the value of 'b' being larger
than zero (a positive number). If the value is larger then 0, addition will be performed
on values of 'a' and 'b', if the value is lower than 0, a substraction will be performed.
A substraction on a negative integer will result in addition (- and - equal a +), therefore 
this function represents an 'absolute' addition.

This tasks illustrates the ability to return operators from if/else statements. It is not that
uncommon as it is possible to return functions from functinons in other programming languages. 
However, what is a bit uncommon is that we are returning a primitive built-in language operator.
